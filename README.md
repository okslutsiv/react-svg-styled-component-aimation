With react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher, and react@16.3.0 and higher
you can import SVGs directly as React components.

Now itâ€™s not necessary to have a full-blown SVG code in your components and animating parts of SVG is as simple as using css transitions for specific parts of our icon which can be achieved by using class names.

The most fun part of SVG animations is the possibility to animate individual paths, shapes and texts.
